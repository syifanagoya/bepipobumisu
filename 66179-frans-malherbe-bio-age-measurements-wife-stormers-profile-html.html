When asked to comment on the matter, he stated:</p>I want to now try and make a difference after the injuries I suffered in 2013 and 2014. It’s still uncertain whether South Africans playing overseas will be picked for the Boks. What that essentially means is that I want to be here and play as many Tests as possible for the Boks.<h3>Frans Malherbe mesurements</h3><p class=align-left>The tighthead prop is one of the most demanding positions in a rugby game.
