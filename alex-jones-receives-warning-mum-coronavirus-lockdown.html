In a 2018 interview, mother and daughter opened up about their bond in a touching interview together in <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Times</a>, with Alex admitting that she became even more dependent on Mary following the birth of her first son Teddy in January 2017, when she was 39.</p><p id=eJeMo-3v3-Xu5 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Alex Jones's husband: Everything you need to know about Charlie Thomson</a></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=edIsKGUqE3dmW data-wc=6><strong>WATCH: Alex Jones in 60 seconds</strong></p><p id=ebViA59qR9enu data-wc=47>"Becoming a mother made me need my own mother more than ever," she shared. "I don't know how I'd have done the first three weeks without her.

"Alex has a great work ethic, but she isn't the most practical, especially when it came to having a baby," she confessed. "I went to visit her before Ted arrived and had to convince her she'd need more than one pack of nappies. But she makes up for it with how loving she is with him and all of us.</p><p id=eGI_sptNTsQMo data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Alex Jones reveals why The One Show has yet to replace Matt Baker</a></strong></p><p id=emPQ4OcUh6h-U data-wc=111>"It was special to spend those first weeks with them, to make her bowls of cawl, full of every vegetable you can think of - you forget to eat when you're a new mum. She quickly got the hang of it, but you should've seen her face when I said I was leaving to go back to Wales. I'll never be too far away. We're teaching Ted bits of Welsh. I'm his 'gu', short for mamgu - Welsh for grandma. I'm secretly hoping it will be his first word. Being a grandparent is all the best bits of being a parent, and I won't take a moment of it for granted."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
