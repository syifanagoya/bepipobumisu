Geary opened up about their plans (or lack thereof) to protect their assets in a very candid Instagram Stories post on March 23, admitting she has no plans to sign on the dotted line on the document that decides who will be entitled to what should they divorce.</p><p>One fan asked the model if "The Masked Singer" judge wanted to get a prenup, to which she shot back, via <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, "I don't know, but I'm not signing one." She then elaborated, "He's not marrying anyone else after me. How do you go from, like the baddest b***h on the planet? Where do you go from there? Trash." In case you were wondering, <a href=#>Thicke has a net worth estimated to be around $10 million</a>.</p><p>Their marriage will be Geary's first, though <a href=#>Thicke was previously married to Paula Patton</a> from 2005 until 2015. He told&nbsp;<a href=#>Billboard</a> in 2011 they didn't sign a prenup, musing, "If I met someone new, I would be able to go into the relationship without that and I'm a romantic and wouldn't plan on marrying someone that I didn't plan on being with forever or want her to have half of everything I have. Including my heart and my soul. I think it's up to the individual. I don't think I ever would [sign one]." No contention here then?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWhpaH92e8CpqaKkXaG8t7GMoJyaqqliv6bCxJqjrGWgp7Kvwc9mp6WZnqh6orTEmptmp5ZiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dqbxuvs6boKdlpJ22pLfEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
