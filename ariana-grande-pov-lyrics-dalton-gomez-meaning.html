On Instagram earlier this year, Grande explained why she wasn't sharing as much about her personal life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Grande has purposely kept their relationship more private; Positions as a whole has given the most detailed look yet at their life together, the happiness they've found, and how Gomez has helped Grande heal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">On Instagram earlier this year, Grande explained why she wasn't sharing as much about her personal life. "Sharing special, personal life things that make u happy on the internet can be truly traumatic," Grande <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a32093981/ariana-grande-dating-life-private-reason/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote in April" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">wrote in April</a>. "I know I’ve taken a step back from doing so to protect my loved ones and myself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">Grande would later share a little more about Gomez, posting a birthday tribute to him in August. "hbd to my baby my best friend my fav part of all the days :) i love u," she wrote.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">In "POV," Grande touches on how deeply Gomez understands her and loves her: "You know me better than I do/Can't seem to keep nothing from you/How you touch my soul from the outside," she sings in one verse. In the chorus, she poignantly adds, "I wanna love me (Ooh)/The way that you love me (Ooh)/Ooh, for all of my pretty/And all of my ugly too/I'd love to see me from your point of view/I wanna trust me (Trust me)/The way that you trust me (Trust me)/Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do/I'd love to see me from your point of view." Throughout the rest of the song, she touches on her insecurities, her initial fear loving again, and how Gomez has helped her get through it.</p><img alt="ariana grande and dalton gomez" title="ariana grande and dalton gomez" width=1042 height=1142 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/capture-d-e-cran-2020-10-30-a-10-47-47-am-1604069276.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-0 et3p2gv0">In all, it's a revealing look at Grande's journey to get where she is now.
