She followed with 2006’s B’Day, 2008’s I Am… Sasha Fierce and 2011’s 4, which all hit No. 1 as well.</p><p>In December 2013, Knowles released her fifth album, Beyoncé, on iTunes without any prior promotion. The visual album was critically acclaimed and made her the first woman in Billboard 200’s history to have her first five albums debut at No. 1.</p><p>In April 2016, two months after releasing the hit single and video “Formation,” Knowles released Lemonade, which earned a five-star rating from Rolling Stone. It also debuted No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and earned her eight wins at the MTV Video Music Awards, making her the most-awarded artist in VMA history.</p><p>Six years later, Knowles hinted at an upcoming seventh studio album when she wiped the profile photos from her various social media platforms. In June 2022, she officially announced Renaissance, which was released the following month. The first single from the record, “Break My Soul,” became Knowles’ 20th Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100, making her one of the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve at least 20 Top 10 singles as a solo artist, alongside <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> and <a href=#>Paul McCartney</a>. She kicked off the Renaissance World Tour in May 2023.</p><p>In 2008, the singer tied the knot with longtime love <a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a>. They welcomed daughter <a href=#>Blue Ivy Carter</a> in January 2012. Knowles revealed via Instagram five years later that she and her husband were expecting twins, and the post broke the world record for most “likes” ever on the platform at the time. Daughter Rumi and son Sir were born in September 2018.</p><p>Knowles considers herself a feminist and has taken stances against police brutality and racial injustice, all of which have been incorporated in her music and visuals.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmiala68r6%2FEZqKnp6ehsrQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
