Words, once spoken, can never be taken back, and the speaker must be ready to face the consequences if they arise. BTB Savage’s tragic demise serves as an example of this statement.</p><p>The late rapper had just started his career and had a long way ahead. Unfortunately, he passed away untimely before he could soar high in the music industry. Born Darrell Gentry, he was shot multiple times on Thursday after 6 pm.</p><p>BTB Savage was found dead alongside bullet-riddled Mercedes in the 2100 block of Mid Lane and San Felipe Street in River Oaks. The cops speculate the rapper’s death to be a “targeted” attack. And it has been reported that two individuals in a dark-colored SUV shot him to death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-2023-04-03T093248.814.png><p>The incident occurred after the late musician detailed the story of how he and his girlfriend killed a robber who attempted to steal their belongings. He claimed it was a self-defense act and didn’t show fear for the gang’s retaliation for their member’s death.</p><p>Although Darrell was arrested for his actions, he was released due to a lack of proof. As his murder happened a few days after the interview, many people believe it was related to the incident. Many assume BTB Savage’s killers to be the gang who killed him to avenge their dead mate.</p><p>Furthermore, BTB Savage’s mother, Bernita Ward, has spoken that he was killed in a targeted shooting. She claims her late son’s death was associated with the group who attempted to rob his San Antonio house in February. She asserts it was retaliation for the thief’s death.</p><p>Bernita had also warned her son to take off images from social media where he was seen standing in a pool of dried blood before a door that was shot through with bullet holes. She had seen comments about people taunting BTB and talking about killing him.</p><p>Although Ward told her kid to let it go, those threats became true. She says,</p><p>I said Don’t respond. Let it go. But their family member came to rob my son.</p><p>It is unfathomable what Bernita is going through after losing her son. BTB Savage was a son, a father, and an inspiring rapper with massive potential. Sadly, he is no more; the rap industry has lost one of its gems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wa2ZZquRq66osYygoKuklqe2prrDZqmompKav7p5wKebZquYpLy1tc2gZJyZo5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
