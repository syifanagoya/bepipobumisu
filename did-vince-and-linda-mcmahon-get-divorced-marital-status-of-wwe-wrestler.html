A former staff of WWE, Rene Dupree also revealed that she heard about Vince and Linda being still legally married but they haven’t lived together in decades.</p><p>Following this news, some online users have even commented that Linda probably secretly divorced Vince because of his affair and immoral behaviors. A&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;user also wrote that Vince has referred to Linda as his former wife recently, indicating that they have legally separated too.</p><p>The WWE has launched an investigation on Vince McMahon after he was alleged of having paid $3 million to a former employee, with whom he had an affair. The allegation claims that Vince hired a woman in 2019 whose salary increased from $100,000 to $200,000 following the alleged affair.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=vince-and-linda-mcmahon-marriage-status-today-are-they-still-together></span>Vince And Linda McMahon Marriage Status Today- Are They Still Together?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As far as we know, Vince And Linda’s betrothal status is on the verge of collapse. It’s probably for the appearance that they have&nbsp;still&nbsp;managed their marital life and put a breath into their already broken marriage.</p><p>Though they do make appearances together at grand events and such but reportedly, they live separately from each other.</p><p>Vince and Linda got married in 1966, and from then on they have they’ve ever since been together. Although the sensitive allegation of affairs could test out any strong relationship and could put a marriage to the edge, she has never released any statement suggesting she divorced her husband till now.</p><p>For now, there are no records of Linda showing any signs of leaving him and putting an end to their relationship but she may do so eventually.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=list-of-vince-mcmahon-affairs></span>List Of Vince McMahon Affairs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is found that even Stephanie McMahon has stated in an interview years ago that Vince McMahon has cheated before on his wife Linda McMahon.</p><p>We could see that Vince has openly made out with many females in WWE too whether it’s just a storyline or show to have viewers increment in the show and raise TRP or an actual thing. He also did not shy away when he made out with Trish stratus in front of his unresponsive wife after she suffered a stroke.</p><p>It’s also been claimed that McMahon has raped a female referee when she rejected his sexual advances. As a result, the first girl referee was sexually abused by the former wrestler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXq3tc2cnGaZnpl6rbXNnZhmpZOirqm7zWaenqxdmba3u9GcnJ1lnZa%2FqsDApWSsrJGpwrR5zp9ksK%2BVYsSzsdKto56qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
