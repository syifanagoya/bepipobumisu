Be aware that this may take a while as the illagers have to spawn nearby and make their way into the village.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-start-a-pillager-raid-in-creative></span>How do you start a Pillager raid in creative?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-start-a-raid-with-a-bad-omen></span>How do you start a raid with a bad omen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-eliminate-pillagers-without-getting-bad-omen></span>How do you eliminate pillagers without getting bad omen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>you <b>killed</b> a <b>pillager</b> with a flag on their back. once they die BY YOUR DAMAGE (really important, that piece) you gain this effect. drink milk to remove it, and you should be fine. if you want to <b>kill</b> them <b>without getting</b> the effect, use a fire enchanted weapon (sword, bow, or crossbow.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-pillager-curse></span>What is the Pillager curse?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>the <b>curse</b> works in a way where if you are in a village, the village gets raided. i also think they go for individual villagers too, since you can trap a villager and make a drop-down farm with the pillagers. If you eliminate the one carrying the banner, you get the bad omen effect.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-tame-a-pillager></span>How do you tame a Pillager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To <b>tame</b> the <b>pillager</b>, you need to break its crossbow. Since a crossbow has a durability of 326, you need the <b>pillager</b> to use its crossbow 326 times to break it! So add 5 shields to your hotbar (we added 6, just in case) and possibly some food.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-pillagers-steal-your-stuff></span>Do pillagers steal your stuff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Pillagers</b> will look for chests and barrels at villagers or players houses, <b>steal</b> its contents and bring it to hiding barrels (buried, inside caves, etc). <b>Pillagers</b> eliminate farms to <b>steal</b> meat, wool, and leather.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-you-eliminate-pillagers></span>Should you eliminate pillagers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Do</b> NOT <b>kill</b> a <b>pillager</b> wearing a banner! Raids spawn near villages (any area with at least <b>one</b> door and a villager) when a player with the Bad Omen status effect enters. If the village being attacked by a raid no longer registers as a village (i.e. all villagers were <b>killed</b> or all doors were broken), the raid will end.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-illager-patrols-attack-villagers></span>Do Illager patrols attack villagers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Behavior. <b>Patrol</b> looks at a <b>villager</b> and attracts their attention. <b>Patrols</b> seek villages, wander around, and <b>attack</b> nearby players, adult <b>villagers</b> ‌ [BEonly], iron golems, snow golems‌ [BedrockEditiononly] and wandering traders.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-pillagers-keep-spawning-near-my-house></span>Why do pillagers keep spawning near my house?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Pillagers spawn</b> because you interact with villages or you live <b>near</b> one. A village in Minecraft is considers to be at least one villager and a bell <b>near</b> the villager. So if you have a bell and a villager, destroy the bell and they should <b>stop spawning</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-get-rid-of-pillager-curse></span>How do I get rid of Pillager curse?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Bad Omen is a negative status effect that causes a raid to happen if a player is in a village. This effect, like the rest, can be removed by drinking milk. Even having one villager nearby is enough to trigger a raid.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-the-illager-banner-do></span>What does the Illager banner do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An <b>Illager banner</b> (also known as an Ominous <b>Banner</b> in Java Edition) <b>is</b> a special <b>banner</b> type that can be carried by <b>Illager</b> captains. Killing an <b>Illager</b> captain that <b>is</b> not on a raid will give the player the Bad Omen effect.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-eliminate-pillager></span>How do you eliminate Pillager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You can lure a Creeper or use TNT to blow up the <b>pillagers</b> once they are together. Multiple blocks of TNT can be more effective but can also destroy the <b>pillager</b> drops.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-get-rid-of-pillager></span>How do I get rid of Pillager?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Pick them off one-by-one with a bow or crossbow, and <b>make</b> sure you keep your distance. Also ensure you <b>have</b> plenty of food, like bread. In more advanced <b>pillager</b>-raiding situations, you may like to use shields and healing/regeneration potions, along with a golden apple or enchanted golden apple.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-pillager-banners-attract-pillagers></span>Do Pillager banners attract pillagers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Minecraft, displaying a <b>Pillager banner</b> will not <b>attract Pillagers</b> to your base. However, if you have the effect “Bad Omen” and you enter a village then <b>pillagers</b> will come to your base and attempt to attack you.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-pillagers-go-away-on-their-own></span>Will pillagers go away on their own?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Depends, if they are raiding a village because of the bad omen effect they dont despawn. But if they spawn close near or at a <b>pillager</b> tower they <b>can</b> despawn like normal mobs.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-loot-in-pillager-outposts></span>Is there loot in Pillager outposts?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Pillager Outposts</b> are semi-rare structures found scattered around <b>the</b> biomes of Minecraft’s Overworld. <b>Pillager Outposts</b> sometimes contain great <b>loot</b>, giving players an incentive to raid them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-there-secret-chests-in-pillager-outpost></span>Are there secret chests in Pillager outpost?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>This is the main structure in the <b>Outpost</b> and has a total of 4 levels. On each side of the Watchtower, you will find 2 illager banners hanging from the top level. Also, on the top level of the Watchtower, you can find a <b>chest</b> filled with goodies.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-pillager-outposts-always-near-villages></span>Are Pillager outposts always near villages?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Java Edition, <b>pillager outposts</b> never generate too close to, or within, <b>villages</b>. They can do so in Bedrock Edition as well generate far away from <b>villages</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-find-a-pillager-mansion></span>How do I find a Pillager mansion?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>These mysterious <b>mansions</b> can only be found in one biome: the Dark Forest.<p><b>#3 – <b>Locate</b> command</b></p><li class=TrT0Xe>Enable Cheats on world/server.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Type /<b>locate</b> in chat.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Add a space, then type <b>mansion</b>.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>In the chat, the player will be given coordinates.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Click on those coordinates to teleport to the <b>mansion</b>.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-a-boss-in-the-woodland-mansion></span>Is there a boss in the Woodland mansion?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>There</b> is no “<b>boss</b>” in <b>woodland mansions</b>–never has been.
