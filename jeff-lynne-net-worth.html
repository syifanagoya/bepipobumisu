He attended the Alderlea Boys' Secondary School. He began playing the guitar from a young age after his father bought him an acoustic guitar, which he still has. When he was 16, he formed the group the Andicaps and then joined a different band, the Chads, the following year.</p><p>Around 1965, he started acquiring studio recording equipment and began learning the ropes of record producing. He also joined a new band, the Nightriders, as a guitarist, though they soon changed their name to the Idle Race. The band did produce two critically acclaimed records, but didn't experience very much commercial success.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Lynne decided to leave the Idle Race in 1970 and joined the band, the Move. He contributed a number of songs to the Move's last two albums. At the same time, he was working on a concept for a new band that was built around rock and classical music â€“ which he called Electric Light Orchestra (ELO).</p><p>ELO came into begin and with original members Lynne, <a href=# title="Bev Bevan Net Worth">Bev Bevan</a>, and Roy Wood, though Wood left in 1972 after ELO produced their first album, "ELO."

Lynne was a huge creative force in the band, as he acted as the producer, songwriter, arranger, lead singer, and guitarist. ELO, however, was not a solo effort as the other members contributed much in the way of co-arranging, integration other instruments, and developing a more symphonic sound.</p><p>By 1977, ELO had reached the pinnacle of their success when they released the double album, "Out of the Blue." It became a chart-topper and was popular around the world. The live performance of the album was also remarkable, featuring an elaborate space ship set and laser light show. They followed up their success with the 1979 album, "Discovery," which held the number one spot on the UK charts for five weeks. Their next album, "Time," in 1981 was science fiction themed, followed by "Messages" in 1983.

In 2001, ELO released their first album in 15 years, "Zoom," which features guest appearances by George Harrison, Ringo Starr, and others. The newest iteration of the band only featured Lynne and Tandy as the original members.

He announced in 2015 that ELO had signed a contract with Columbia Records, which resulted in the "Alone in the Universe" album and a world tour. He has continued touring with ELO throughout the late 2010s and announced a number ELO album, "From Out of Nowhere," in 2019.</p><p>Throughout his career, Lynne has received numerous awards and accolades. Many of the albums he has produced have won Grammy Awards or nominations. He personally has received an honorary doctorate degree from Birmingham City University and was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015. He also was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of ELO in 2017.
