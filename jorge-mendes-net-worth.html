Jorge Mendes is the founder of the agency GestiFute. His notable clients include <a href=# title="Cristiano Ronaldo Net Worth">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href=# title="Diego Costa Net Worth">Diego Costa</a>, and <a href=# title="David de Gea Net Worth">David de Gea</a>. Mendes also represents many athletes outside of football, such as Formula 1 racer <a href=# title="Charles Leclerc Net Worth">Charles Leclerc</a>, surfer Frederico Morais, and tennis player Jo√£o Sousa.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jorge Mendes was born on January 7, 1966 in Lisbon, Portugal to Maria and Manuel.</p><h2 id=football-agent-career-1996-2010><strong>Football Agent Career, 1996-2010</strong></h2><p>In 1996, Mendes founded GestiFute, a Portuguese company providing agent services for footballers. That year, Mendes closed his first deal as a football agent when he brokered Nuno Esp√≠rito Santo's move from Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es to Deportivo de La Coru√±a. He went on to attract more Portuguese players after that deal, including Jorge Andrade. Mendes also signed some promising young footballers such as Cristiano Ronaldo and <a href=# title="Ricardo Quaresma Net Worth">Ricardo Quaresma</a>. In 2002, he conducted his first major international transfer when he oversaw Hugo Viana's move from Sporting CP to the Premier League's Newcastle United. The next year, Mendes oversaw the transfer of Ronaldo from Sporting CP to Manchester United. He cemented his reputation in international football in 2004 when he brokered Jos√© Mourinho's move from Porto to Chelsea, despite Mourinho already having an agent. Following that major deal, every Portuguese player that went to Chelsea was a client of Mendes, including Paulo Ferreira, Maniche, Tiago, and Ricardo Carvalho.</p><p>In 2007, Mendes oversaw the transfers of Nani and Anderson to Chelsea; Pepe to Real Madrid; and Sim√£o to Atl√©tico Madrid. After Mourinho left Chelsea in September of 2007, Mendes oversaw his move to Inter Milan in 2008. The fee for the transfer made Mourinho the highest-paid coach in the world at the time. Also in 2008, Mendes brokered the deal that brought manager <a href=# title="Luiz Felipe Scolari Net Worth">Luiz Felipe Scolari</a> to Chelsea. The following year, he brokered the ¬£80 million transfer of Ronaldo from Manchester United to Real Madrid. Mendes generated some controversy in the summer of 2010 when he oversaw the transfer of Beb√© from Manchester United to Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es, ignoring Beb√©'s agent Gon√ßalo Reis in the process. Reis was later fired by Beb√©, and the transfer was investigated by Portuguese police.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288945 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jorge-Mendes.jpg alt="Jorge Mendes" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288945 class=wp-caption-text>PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP/Getty Images</p><h2 id=2014-summer-transfer-window><strong>2014 Summer Transfer Window</strong></h2><p>During the summer transfer window in 2014, Mendes brokered four of the biggest deals worldwide and earned around ¬£30 million. The deals consisted of <a href=# title="James Rodr√≠guez Net Worth">James Rodr√≠guez</a>'s move from Monaco to Real Madrid; √Ångel Di Mar√≠a's move from Real Madrid to Manchester United; Diego Costa's move from Atl√©tico Madrid to Chelsea; and Eliaquim Mangala's move from Porto to Manchester City.</p><h2 id=third-party-ownership-allegations><strong>Third-party Ownership Allegations</strong></h2><p>In 2014, an investigation by the Guardian implicated Mendes in a breach of FIFA regulations pertaining to third-party ownership and conflicts of interest in player representation, particularly in relation to Chelsea and its former chief executive Peter Kenyon. Subsequently, UEFA announced its intention to crack down on third-party ownership practices.</p><h2 id=other-clients><strong>Other Clients</strong></h2><p>After the takeover of the EFL Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2016, Mendes became an agent for the club. Alongside the team's general manager Andrea Butti and sporting director Kevin Thelwell, he helped sign 12 players during the 2016 summer transfer window. Less than two years later, during the January 2018 transfer window, Mendes began working with the Premier League club Swansea City.</p><p>Mendes has a number of clients from sports other than football. They include Formula 1 racing driver Charles Leclerc, surfer Frederico Morais, triple jump champion Patricia Mamona, and tennis player Jo√£o Sousa. In 2021, Mendes entered the world of cycling with his sports marketing company Polaris Sports, which partnered with Corso Sports to promote riders Ruben Guerreiro and Jo√£o Almeida.</p><h2 id=honors><strong>Honors</strong></h2><p>Widely considered one of the most influential football agents in the world, Mendes was named Best Agent of the Year by the Globe Soccer Awards ten times between 2010 and 2020.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In the summer of 2015, Mendes married his longtime girlfriend Sandra. Together, they have three children named Jorge Jr., Beatriz, and B√°rbara.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97y5qusp2iqHyru9GgnGallaOxpr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
