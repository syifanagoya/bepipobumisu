Who will be cast to play Abby in the second season of the popular <a href=#>HBO</a> series The Last of Us? Will it be Florence Pugh, well-known for her role in the 2021 film Black Widow? One industry insider claims on X that sources are saying Pugh was offered the role of Abby before Hollywood strikes led to the suspension of filming. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The HBO hit series The Last of Us debuted on the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> channel in January of 2023, and it is one of the channel’s most popular creations to date. Well received by viewers and critics alike, the show was viewed by nearly 5 million viewers in just the first day.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, The Last of Us has been nominated for 24 Primetime Emmy Awards, and each episode averages nearly 32 million viewers. The show was so popular among viewers that it was immediately renewed for a second season.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s been noticed by fans that The Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann follows Shannon Berry on Instagram.</strong></p><p>Cast with stars <a href=#>Pedro Pascal</a> (who played lead protagonist, Joel) and Bella Ramsey (who played the beloved Ellie), The Last of Us has since been labeled one of the best video game adaptations of our time.&nbsp;</p><p>Season 2 of The Last of Us will bring about new characters and new struggles for the main story players. Abby being one of the most pivotal characters in the second game has drawn quite a lot of hype on social media and among fans of the show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-last-of-us-1-900x524.png><p>Just who will showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin get to fill the shoes of the rugged and resolute Abby? Both Druckmann and Mazin have teased that the show had already cast the role before the SAG-AFTRA strikes were underway.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>An industry insider took to social media to claim Florence Pugh had been offered the role of Abby for Season 2 of The Last of Us.</strong></p><p>However, due to the nature of the strike, both men are still unable to release the information to the public. Some fans and a few Hollywood insiders speculate that Florence Pugh will be cast, though there is very little hard evidence in the public eye leading to any truth in that speculation.&nbsp;</p><p>Social media patrons seem to tell a different tale, leading more towards Shannon Berry being cast in the role of Abby. Though production on The Last of Us season 2 has been halted due to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers’ inability to come to an agreement with the SAG-AFTRA demands, fans have been diligent in their search to find answers.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been noticed by fans that The Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann follows Shannon Berry on Instagram. Berry also follows the show’s official account and both Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal’s Instagram pages, making the connection seem strong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Since then, The Last of Us has been nominated for 24 Primetime Emmy Awards, and each episode averages nearly 32 million viewers.</strong></p><p>However the story pans out, in the end, fans should feel confident in the show creator’s ability to choose the right woman for the role. Mazin and Druckmann’s casting of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey didn’t come without speculation from the crowd, but the end result was magic.&nbsp;</p><p>Whoever is chosen to play the role of Abby Anderson — Florence Pugh, Shannon Berry, or someone else — should definitely keep their guard up. The character plays a very controversial part in the storyline, and <a href=#>The Last of Us</a> fans are unyielding in their devotion to the protection of Ellie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ikkajBbrvFZqysZZahvLOxzZycZqilnLVvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
