Miguel Angel Jimenez made his European Tour debut in the late 80s. He won his first Open tournament in 1992, taking first at the Piaget Belgian Open. Though he has remained within the Top 100 European players for the majority of his career, he has had varying levels of success with tournament play from year to year. Since 2004, he has shown a great deal more consistency of play, however, and has won multiple tournaments per year. He has won 21 European Tour tournaments, and has finished in the Top 10 at the Masters Tournament, the US Open, and The Open Championship. He has won the Alfred Dunhill Cup twice, the Seve Trophy, and the Ryder Cup twice, in team play, and has also scored the very rare "albatross" on more than one occasion.

He attended school in Malaga and began playing golf from a young age. However, he did not make it onto the European Tour until 1988.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Jiménez improved over the first few years on the European Tour. Since 1989, he has finished inside the top 100 on the European Tour Order of Merit. His first win came at the Piaget Belgian Open in 1992. In 1994, he finished fifth on the European Tour Order of Merit. One of his early career highlights came in 1994 when he scored an albatross on the 17th hole at Valderrama during the Volvo Masters. He then suffered from some weaker seasons but bounced back in 1998. In both 1998 and 1999, he finished fourth on the Order of Merit and won four tournaments. In 1999, he came second in the WGC-American Express Championship and also made his Ryder Cup debut.</p><p>He experienced another lull in his career over the following years but again bounced back in 2004. That year, he again finished fourth on the Order of Merit, winning four European Tour events, more than any other player. In 2005, he continued doing well, winning the Omega Hong Kong Open and the Celtic Manor Wales Open. He also won the Spanish Pairs final that year with Andrés Jiménez at La Cala Resort.</p><p>In 2008, he had another good season with two wins, including the BMW PGA Championship. He also earned a spot on the 2008 Ryder Cup team and finished the season ranking fourth on the Order of Merit.

He became the oldest player ever to win on the European Tour.</p><p>In late 2012, while skiing in southern Spain, Jiménez fell and suffered a tibial fracture, requiring surgery and keeping him out of competition for several months. He returned to play in April of 2013 in the Open de Espana but missed the cut. He returned to the European tour in late May. In December of that year, he retained his Hong Kong Open title and broke his own record as the European Tour's oldest winner.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-225385 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Miguel-Angel-Jimenez.jpg alt width=594 height=407 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-225385 class=wp-caption-text>Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</p><p>In April of 2014, Jiménez made his Champion Tour debut by shooting a course record of 65 at the Greater Gwinnett Championship.
