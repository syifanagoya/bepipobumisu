The actress shows off her gorgeous body in a red bathing suit in one of her latest social media photos, taken during her Italian getaway. "Mostly food, a little champagne, but mostly food … I'm never leaving," she captioned the Instagram post. How does the actress keep herself so fit? Read on to see 5 ways Lana Condor stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1473795472.jpg><p><span>"I also drink at least half my body weight, in ounces, of water every day," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>E!</span></a><span> about the importance of hydration. "Staying hydrated is such a must- and I genuinely feel better when my body is fully hydrated." According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, hydration is important for a variety of reasons. Water helps get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements, keeps your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, and helps protect sensitive tissues.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1516777375.jpg><p><span>Lana trains with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Paolo Mascitti</span></a><span>i who works out with her at the gym five days a week, guiding her with cardio and high-intensity interval training like squats and lunges. While her workouts are grueling, "it's worth it, because now I have a booty," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Self</span></a><span>. They also do exercises with a slam ball. "I hate it, but it's very effective," she said. "If I'm having a bad day or I have a little aggression, slamming that ball down on the ground really helps me. It always makes me feel a lot better when it's finished." There is a lot of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>research</span></a><span> backing up the benefits of HIIT workouts, including body fat reduction, improved cardiovascular function, and mental health. It is also time effective.</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Mental health comes first, says Lana. "If my body is so sore and I need a day off, he's so understanding about that," she said. "My mental health is the priority, and my mental health is always better when I am active. But sometimes when your body hurts, you're like, I can't do anything, I don't want to get up. And so he's very patient. If there's a day that I feel the need to be a little bit more gentle with myself, he's great."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1503712740.jpg><p><span>Lana appreciates exercise classes. "I always do a little bit better in a class setting or in-person, just because I think that I have a competitive nature in workout classes," she told Self. "So I feel like I can really hit it hard." Pilates, boxing, and hot yoga sculpt classes are a few classes she likes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lana's approach to diet is "to eat what makes you happy," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Bon Appetit</span></a><span>. Her theory? Eat what you want but in moderation. "I've tried to take away noodles in my life, and it just doesn't work—I'm miserable! I always think to myself, 'Well, I could starve myself and go on a diet and be fucking miserable. But what if I die in a plane crash? Or, what if I have the most amazing meal of my life, and then I could still die in a plane crash, but at least I'd have a happy belly!"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpZmelnqku82dpqtlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyYsqtdnrpuusSvnKtlnJqut7XNoGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
