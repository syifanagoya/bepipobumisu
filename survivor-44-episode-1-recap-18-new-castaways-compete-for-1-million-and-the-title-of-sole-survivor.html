The instructions read, “Inside this bag there are three packages. Two of them say ‘lose your vote.’ One is a secret advantage. You must draw one package. If you draw the advantage, congratulations, you are done. But if you draw a ‘lose your vote,’ you have an option to draw again from the remaining two packages. If you draw another ‘lose your vote,’ then you cannot vote at your next two tribal councils.”</p><p>The note concluded with, “When you are finished, return to your tribe camp. In a game in which information is valuable, what will you tell your tribemates about your journey?”</p><p>In the game, Sarah and Lauren both won brand new advantages to the Survivor franchise. Sarah earned the Inheritance Advantage, allowing her to steal all idols and advantages played at a tribal council, while Lauren earned the Bank My Vote Advantage, allowing her to forgo her vote and have an additional one down the road.</p><p>Unfortunately for Matt, he lost both of his votes, being unable to participate in his next TWO tribal councils and gaining no advantage from the journey. The 27-year-old only told the Soka tribe part of the truth, sharing that he only lost one vote instead of two, which could definitelyyyy lead to complications later on in the game.</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_melanie has-avatar" readability=3.8374455732946><img data-del=avatar alt="Melanie Rooten" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_5785-Small-96x96.jpeg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Originally from Southern California and currently residing in Music City, Melanie graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a BA in Journalism before beginning her career as a music and entertainment journalist.
