Let me tell you, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone hit the drums as hard as this person,” Grohl, 53, told the packed stadium during the London show. “But beyond that, he’s a member of our family, and he needs to be here tonight with all of us. I think it makes sense that he’s going to come up and play with us tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome, Mr. Shane Hawkins on the drums.”</p><p>At Friday’s Boston Calling show, <a href=#>Taylor was honored</a> with the band’s performance of “Cold Day in the Sun.” Grohl told the audience, “I’m gonna do it for Taylor’s family. And I’m gonna do it for Taylor. Because we used to sing it together.”</p><p>Since the Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders frontman’s death, <strong>Josh Freese</strong> has taken over drumming duties with the “Everlong” performers. At Friday’s show, the new wore a cheeky T-shirt that said, “Fingers crossed for the new guy.”</p><p>He received a warm welcome from the crowd, who roared with applause every time the camera panned over to him. Grohl also introduced the new drummer, saying the band would not be able to tour without him.</p><p>Freese, who has previously toured with Guns N’ Roses and <strong>Sting</strong>, shared a photo from the Massachusetts set. “Surreal, bittersweet, optimistic,” he wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Foo Fighters will release their first album post-Hawkins’ death on June 2, titled But Here We Are.</p><p>Reporting by Leanne Aciz Stanton</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN5x5qupKGeqHq0u81mqqGZnpp6q7vIp6pmnp%2Bkeqe1xqGrnqqjYrOwvoypnKuen6e6orrCnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
