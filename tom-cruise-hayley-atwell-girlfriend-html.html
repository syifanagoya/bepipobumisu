She started her career in 2005 and has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">starred</a> in over 45 projects.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Some of her notable projects are Fear of Fanny, The Duchess, The Pillars of the Earth, Captain America: The First Avenger, Rosmersholm, and Agent Carter.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She has also been nominated for various awards like the British Independent Film Award, Golden Globe Award, Laurence Olivier Award, and Saturn Award. Altogether, she has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nominated</a> for 14 awards.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Atwell’s professional career is well known, but the details about her personal life are limited.</p><p>Here is everything you need to know about her family, relationships, and other lesser-known facts about the actress.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hayley Atwell’s Parents&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actress is the only daughter of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">parents</a>&nbsp;— Allison Cain and Grant Atwell. Hayley grew up with her British mother in West London after her father walked out when the actress was only two years old.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cain, being a single mother, brought&nbsp;her daughter up like her best friend. As a result, Hayley is highly attached to her.</p><p>The actress describes her mother as a wonderful woman but “heartbreakingly vulnerable.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, Grant differs from Cain. He is part Native American and a shaman who is “quite ethereal,” as his daughter describes him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Grant is a spiritual man who sees good in everything. He is supportive of his daughter’s career and sees it as “the most spiritual thing anyone can do on the planet.”</p><p>The qualities Hayley inherited are the best from both worlds. She learned how to use her voice, confidence, and be organized from&nbsp;her mother, whereas she learned compassion and empathy from her father.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Hayley Atwell’s Education&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">studied</a> at the Sion-Manning Roman Catholic Girl's School in West London. She was an excellent student who did very well academically.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She then went to London Oratory School, where she took A-Levels. Then, after a hiatus, she went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.&nbsp;</p><p>The school is renowned. It boasts famous alumni like Daniel Craig, Orlando Bloom, Lily James, Jodie Whittaker, and Ewan McGregor, among others.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Atwell trained for three years at Guildhall and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduated</a> in 2005 with a BA in acting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Is Hayley Atwell Dating Tom Cruise?</h2><p>The actress has kept her relationships relatively private. Not much is known about her past boyfriends, but recently, she is rumored to be dating <a href=# rel=follow>Tom Cruise</a>.</p><p>Atwell has joined the&nbsp;Mission: Impossible&nbsp;franchise for its seventh and eighth installments. She is working with the Hollywood legend, and as a result, they have been hanging out a lot.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This has sparked <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumors</a> of the pair dating. While neither of them has confirmed it, Mission Impossible’s production team has spilled the beans about them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two hit it off ever since they first met on set for Mission: Impossible 7 last year. Apparently, the pair have become “fairly inseparable” following the lockdowns.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Recently, they were photographed together attending the Wimbledon finals on July 10, 2021, at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London.</p><p>The pair were joined by fellow actress <a href=# rel=follow>Pom Klementieff</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not clear if Atwell was single before the rumors with Cruise. In December 2020, The Things <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;the actress was the girlfriend of&nbsp;a medical doctor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Atwell and her mystery man are childhood friends who have known each other since they were ten years old. The duo later reconnected and changed their relationship label from friends to lovers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Atwell has not revealed her beau’s name or identity.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hayley Atwell and ‘Agent Carter’</h2><p>Atwell is also the first Marvel comic’s heroine to have her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">own series</a>&nbsp;— Agent Carter. The show ran for two seasons and 18 episodes on ABC from January 6, 2015, to March 1, 2016.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The series was well-received by critics but&nbsp;was low on viewership. Unfortunately, Agent Carter was canceled by ABC on May 12, 2016.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hayley Atwell’s Secret Talent&nbsp;</h2><p>Atwell is not only an excellent actress but also a talented ventriloquist. She can talk with her mouth closed with perfect clarity.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">learned</a> the skill from her mother when she was young. First, she puffs up her cheeks like a puffer fish with her lips sealed. Then she articulates by rolling her tongue.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Atwell has showcased her secret talent in various talks shows and radios, including Q on CBS and Jimmy Kimmel Live.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyfonqkvtSiqp5lmJbGrbHYZpitr5WhuW6zyKujn6qZmrulesetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
