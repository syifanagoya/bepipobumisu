According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Network</a>, Florence makes chicken noodle soup using nine-ingredient chicken stock.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_41>He puts all the ingredients — fresh herbs, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, and chicken — in a large pot and lets it simmer on the stove. This is all typical of any chicken noodle soup but Florence tosses in something unexpected.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_45>What sets his chicken noodle soup apart from others is the addition of a root vegetable. Yes, a root vegetable. Specifically a turnip. The cookbook author puts a turnip in his chicken stock because, as he once explained on Food 911, it’s his “secret weapon.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_19>“My little secret weapon when I’m making chicken stock is a turnip,” he said. “I really love that smell.”</p><p id=par-6_16>Then he continues making the stock, leaving it to simmer until the chicken is fully cooked.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make Florence’s chicken noodle soup&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_51>Now that the chicken stock is made it’s time to move forward with the next step in Florence’s chicken noodle soup recipe. He softens onions, garlic, celery, and carrots in a pan with fresh thyme and a bay leaf. Then he adds chicken stock and brings the liquid to a boil.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_42>Next is the noodles. Once they’re tender Florence tosses in shredded chicken from the stock. He lets the meat simmer for a few minutes before seasoning it to taste with salt and pepper. Lastly, he tops the soup with parsley before serving.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_19>Florence’s chicken noodle soup, including the stock, should take just over two hours to make per his recipe instructions.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-food-network-star-s-recipe-has-nearly-500-reviews>The Food Network star’s recipe has nearly 500 reviews</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tyler-Florence-does-a-cooking-demonstration-at-the-2014Food-Network-New-York-City-Wine-Food-Festival.jpg><p id=par-10_45>At the time of writing, Florence’s chicken noodle soup has been reviewed a whopping 494 times on Food Network’s website.
