His replacement, reported <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>, was Dan Rather. Rather officially took over on March 9, 1981. While Cronkite was known for his signature sign-off, "That's the way it is,"&nbsp;Rather initially offered a somewhat generic alternative:&nbsp;"That's our report tonight,"&nbsp;Rather said&nbsp;in his debut newscast.&nbsp;"Until tomorrow, Dan Rather, 'CBS Evening News,' good night."&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;few years later, Rather concocted a new sign-off that was far more distinctive —&nbsp;so much so that it left many viewers confused when he started to end his broadcasts by stating his name and adding a single word:&nbsp;"Courage." The new sign-off wasn't exactly embraced by viewers, who responded with a collective, "Huh?"</p><p>Asked about criticism of his new sign-off, Rather took it in stride.&nbsp;″Don't overanalyze it. There's no deep, hidden meaning,″ Rather said in a 1986 interview with the&nbsp;AP. ″It's a greeting and salutation that I've been using with friends for years. It's not a preachment. I just like the sound of the word.″ Years later, in a <a href=#>Reddit AMA</a>, Rather explained that "courage"&nbsp;was "my father's favorite word." He also acknowledged that&nbsp;"the network brass" didn't love it. "For reasons that were never clear to me, they thought it was somehow dangerous or at a minimum, inappropriate and it ought to be stopped,"&nbsp;Rather divulged.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXFgbYJ1e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDInaWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdma6vedGaq6GdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
