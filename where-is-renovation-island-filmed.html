On this trip, the family merely spent a day at San Andros but fell head over heels in love with the place.</p><p>The HGTV couple had their eyes set on one of the island’s abandoned and rundown resort called the Emerald Palms at the time.

We saw in 2019 that after pulling a lot of strings together and after many sleepless nights the Baeumlers were able to throw the doors of&nbsp;<a href=#>Caerula Mar Club </a>resort-wide open.</p><p>However, just when it was time to welcome the guests, the place had to be shut down thanks to the global health crisis.</p><p>Bryan told to the <a href=#>Toronto Sun</a> that the opening day magic “didn’t last very long.”As international travel shut down, the family was stuck on an island with their children. However, being shut up on a beautiful island for months does have its downsides.</p><p>Sarah revealed in her interview that the challenges ranged from getting supplies to South Andros Island to figuring out how to keep their kids entertained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfnbS1wo6wn56qlWK2tHnRnqWorpGptrC6jKKqpZmemXqntcumnJ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
